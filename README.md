# Quartet-Anki
Anki Note Type for study of Quartet vocabulary (or any Japanese vocab). Card design based on work by [u/TrainOfPotatoes](https://www.reddit.com/user/TrainOfPotatoes/).

## How To Import into Anki

- Download the [template file](template-with-example.apkg)
- Import into your Anki by either double clicking on the file (on Windows) or choosing "Import File" within the Anki app

There now should be a new deck containing a single example note with the 3 card types "Listening", "Reading", "Production". If that is the case, the note type is now also available to be used when creating new cards for your own deck.

The template deck can be deleted - it does not remove the note type.

## How To Use

- **Disable autoplay of audio in deck options**
- **Download fonts** "NotoSansJP" (can be found [here](https://en.bestfonts.pro/font/download-web/5c8a5b8f7dd582046594053d/NotoSansJP-Black-Alphabetic)) and "UDDigiKyokasho" ([here](https://m.fontke.com/font/24526460/download/))
  - save as "NotoSansJP-Black-Alphabetic.ttf" and "UDDigiKyokashoN-R.ttc"
  - copy both to anki collection.media folder on windows/linux/??. After syncing to ankiweb, it should also be available on your ankidroid.
