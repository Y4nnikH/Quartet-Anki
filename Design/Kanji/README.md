# Quartet Kanji
Anki Note Type for study of Kanji-Characters used in the Quartet textbook (or any Japanese Kanji). Card design based the one used in [Kodansha kanji learner's course](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/779483253).

## How To Import into Anki

- Download the [template file]()
- Import into your Anki by either double clicking on the file (on Windows) or choosing "Import File" within the Anki app

There now should be a new deck containing a single example note with the 2 card types "Recognition" and "Recall". If that is the case, the note type is now also available to be used when creating new cards for your own deck.

The template deck can be deleted - it does not remove the note type.

## How To Use

- Keep the cards in a deck structure like this:
```
- 日本語
  - Quartet
    - Lection 1
    - Lection 2
    - ...
  - Quartet 漢字
    - Lection 1
